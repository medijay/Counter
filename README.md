Basically in this project, we build a counter that with three buttons.
One to increase the number of the counter
Another button to reduce the number of the counter
And a reset button to return the number back to zero
I also added some styling with javascript to change the color of the number to green while increasing and red when reducing
Also some css styling to hover around the button
